Java Hot Draw Finite State Machine


This is my source code for CS409 Software Archutecture and Design assessment.
It is based on Murray Woods modernised version of Java Hot Draw (JHD) avaiable here:
    http://classes.myplace.strath.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=481826
    
The aim of this project is to extend JHD to draw a Finite State Machine (FSM), giving it an input string, showing the end state.
